## Supabase Setup

This application can use Supabase for persistent data storage. To set up Supabase:

1. Create a new Supabase project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create the following tables in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Drafts table
CREATE TABLE drafts (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Teams table
CREATE TABLE teams (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  draft_id BIGINT REFERENCES drafts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  captain TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Players table
CREATE TABLE players (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  draft_id BIGINT REFERENCES drafts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  ppg DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  rpg DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  apg DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  fg DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  fi DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  probability DECIMAL DEFAULT 0,
  rank INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  drafted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  drafted_by TEXT,
  drafted_at BIGINT,
  team_id BIGINT REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```
